A lot to dig into in this paper. You should probably just read the whole thing, and maybe some of the cited papers.
*BIG POINTS*:
1. Racism is very much alive, and it kills black people (s/o to all my Republican friends)
2. Rhode Island is WAY more racist than most of Texas (s/o to all my northeast Democrat friends), and, more broadly, severe racism is endemic throughout the East and Midwest
3. Internet search history data allows you to get a more accurate account of someone's actual views outside of offline social pressures, and can even be used to predict outbreaks of certain diseases better than pharmacy records
