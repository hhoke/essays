  After paying a lot of attention to very small creatures, I came to a bittersweet realization: the world inhabited by animals below a certain size is so unlike the world I live in, I can barely grasp how different it is. Unlike the owl or the mouse, the tiny beetle has, I suspect, no way of seeing me in any way similar to the way that I consider myself. A bear may not understand a house, but certainly has some concept of a dwelling, and has the sense not to walk through a wall. A beetle crawls through some crevice without ever really knowing he has passed through a wall and entered my house. Waving his antennae and questing onward, he has no idea why the surface he walks across is covered with an unnatural dew. He lacks the perspective to follow the beatiful lines traced across the bathroom mirror's surface by his labored shuffling. He will most likely die, lost inside something he could never hope to conceive of.

  I wonder if it is any better for animals of a more relatable size. A human could comprehend a map of cul de sacs and artificial ponds and understand it in a way a fox could not; but it is rarely the case that he does. The fact that a man can speak the word "subdivision" is immaterial. Like the fox, the man does not encounter a newly-developed subdivision on the subdivision's own terms. Perhaps the lawyer or the real estate developer or the civil engineer comes closer, each in their own way. But an ordinary person only experiences the subdivision through the ways it impacts his immediate life, and perhaps the forseeable future, if he is forward-thinking.

  What is global climate change to a polar bear? I wonder if they could give a name to the thing destroying them. They probably don't even understand there is some thing destroying them; each only understanding their own individual demise. I begin to appreciate why people pray for guidance from on high.

  I look down on this beetle, and I wonder where you have to stand to see how I am going to die.

  Will he even know that he is lost? How does a beetle feel lost? I can only guess the ways in which he would percieve that his environment is strange and increasingly unfamiliar. Hurting and unfixed in the world, adrift in ways he could not possibly be prepared for. The best I can do is cherish him for a moment before I turn away. He is encrusted with droplets of shower mist, and they catch the light, softly glimmering. I am struck by his color, the beautiful shade of dark grey blending in to bright, pale green. It must hide him so well, there, where he ought to be.
