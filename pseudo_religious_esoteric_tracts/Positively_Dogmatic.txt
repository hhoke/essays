The statement "God is immense or absolutely immeasurable." is a _de fide_ dogma of The Church, the eighth and highest level of dogma in Roman Catholicism. As such, it is considered to be an essential part of Catholic faith, denial of which is heresy. Similarly important are the dogmas "God is absolutely simple", "God is absolutely immutable", and "There is only One God", which establish the Unitary nature of the Supreme Deity. These items of faith are more commonly known to laypeople by the following prayer, traditionally used in Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament:

[The Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly raised, facing the people, speaks]

Behold, the Lamb of God.

[together with the people he proclaims]

In Awe at the size of this Lad. Simply immense.

[The Priest, facing the altar, quietly adds]

Absolute Unit.

[The Priest then reverently consumes the Body of Christ.]
